# Custom-Functions-For-LOVE2d
I made some qualify of life functions in this file, please also note these functions are made by someone who started out by programming python and it might make it a little more like python. I hope to add more in the future.

If some of the functions don't work please let me know but I will make sure they don't through any errors, only in this branch so far.

All I ask for is that you give a link to this repository if you used my functions.

You can find the LÃ–VE 2d framework here: https://love2d.org/
